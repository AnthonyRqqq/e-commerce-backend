## Description
    
 This project is a mockup of the backend portion of an E-Commerce website. The user is able to create, update, view, and delete data listed in different tables at any time, as well as view data in one table that is related to another data item elsewhere.

## Installation
    
 To install, clone code to local machine.
    
## Usage
    
 To use, first run "npm i" to install dependencies. Then run the "schema.sql" file to create the database. Next run "npm run seed" to seed the database. Finally run "node server" to start the server. From there, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests may be used as desired.
